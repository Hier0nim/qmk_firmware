// Set the mouse settings to a comfortable speed/accuracy trade-off,
// assuming a screen refresh rate of 60 Htz or higher
// The default is 50. This makes the mouse ~3 times faster and more accurate
#define MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL 16
// The default is 20. Since we made the mouse about 3 times faster with the previous setting,
// give it more time to accelerate to max speed to retain precise control over short distances.
#define MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX 40
// The default is 300. Let's try and make this as low as possible while keeping the cursor responsive
#define MOUSEKEY_DELAY 100
// It makes sense to use the same delay for the mouseweel
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_DELAY 100
// The default is 100

// Enable rapid switch from tap to hold, disables double tap hold auto-repeat.
#define QUICK_TAP_TERM 0

// Enable bilateral combinations with a hold time threshold
// The last mod-tap hold will convert to the corresponding mod-tap tap if another key on the same hand is tapped during the hold, unless a key on the other hand is tapped first.
// This prevents accidental modifier combinations, especially those caused by rollover on home row mods.
// Holds longer than 500 milliseconds will permit same hand combinations.
